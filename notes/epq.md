# Building a Snooker Scoring App
## Contents
- ### Designing
    - Which features will I include? How will I implement them whilst ensuring clear but minimalist UI / UX?
        - Player Selection Menu
        - Score
        - Scoring System
        - Player Statistics
    - Which design style will I choose
        - Minimalism
        - Neuemorphism
        - Skeuomorphism
        - Multiple Themes, chosen by user

- ### Coding
    - Which tech stack will I use?
        - Mobile Framework
            - Offline Website
                - WebGUI wrapper
            - Real app
                - Native Flutter
        - Database
            - JSON accessible through Chrome's new FileAccessAPI
                - Data would be stored in LocalStorage and updated / loaded optionally upon user request
            -  Node.js + Express + Localhost
                - JSON would be updated constantly, ensuring no data loss if LocalStorage is cleared
                - This framework doesn't have native support for android, Tmux (terminal emulation) would be used to manage express localhost
            - Google Spreadsheet Database
                - This would allow multiple devices to access the same data (not a localhost).
        - Frontend
            - Vanilla HTML, CSS, Javascript
            - React, with external components
                - Maybe not worth talking about, as it's too hard to explain / differentiate frontend frameworks
    - How will I ensure my code effectively manages different states and asynchronous processes?
        - Create a flow chart managing all possible program states
        - Use a consistent object exchange system
        - Clearly differentiate between global and local objects / variables
        - Ensure tests are run and passed for every function before main runtime
            - For example, the function that will calculate player statistics would be given test data, then it's output would be compared to a known correct source.
